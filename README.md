# VoronoiMap2D

Multithread implementation of the 2D exact Euclidean distance transform algorithm and Voronoi map extraction on the discrete grid.

For more generic implementation (arbitrary dimensions, other metrics), please have a look to [DGtal](dgtal.org).

This project comes alongside with the [lecture note]()
